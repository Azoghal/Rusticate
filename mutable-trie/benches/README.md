To get these benchmarks working, create a file `sequences.in` and a file `lzw_sequences.in`.

Populate the `sequences.in` file with character sequences on each line, for example 1000 words of lorem ipsum.

Populate the `lzw_sequences.in` file with a single character sequence on one line, for example.
